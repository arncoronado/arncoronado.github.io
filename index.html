		Hi! I'm Angelo Coronado and I'm a Computer Science student currently studying in UP Los Banos. I was born on March 11, 1999 and I currently live in Marikina. I love playing video games. My favorite video games right now are League of Legends, Overwatch and Rust. 
		I'm also very into PC building and mechanical keyboards. The one that I have now is a Corsair K65 RGB, which I'm planning to replace with the Obins Anne Pro RGB for better portability. I'm also single.

		What do you expect from your teacher? 
	</h2>
	<P>
		I expect my teacher to be very knowledgeable when it comes to the subject matter, as well as being easily approachable when in need. I expect him to also be fair in assessment.
